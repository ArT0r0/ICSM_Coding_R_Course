# Imperial College School of Medicine (ICSM) Coding Society R Programming Course

## Course Overview

This repository contains all the scripts used in the ICSM Coding Society's R Programming course. Our course provides a practical introduction to R programming, focusing on data manipulation, analysis, and visualisation skills that are particularly relevant for Medics and Medical students in healthcare and medical research contexts but are also applicaple elsewhere.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Work with different data types and structures in R
- Create and manipulate matrices and dataframes
- Clean and prepare datasets for analysis
- Implement data visualisation techniques
- Have an idea of how to use statistical methods to analyse data
- Create efficient analyses using lists and apply functions

## Course Structure

The course is divided into six lessons:

1. **R Basics**: Introduction to data types, operators, loops, vectors, and functions
   - [01_Basics.R](01_Basics.R)

2. **Matrices**: Building, indexing, and performing operations with matrices
   - [02_Matrices.R](02_Matrices.R)

3. **Dataframes**: Loading, exploring, and manipulating data
   - [03_Dataframes.R](03_Dataframes.R)

4. **Data Wrangling**: Cleaning data, handling missing values, and preparing datasets for analysis
   - [04_Wrangling.R](04_Wrangling.R)

5. **Grammar of Graphics**: Creating and customising visualisations using ggplot2
   - [05_Visualisations.R](05_Visualisations.R)

6. **Lists, Applies and Stat Tests**: Working with lists, apply functions and statistical tests for data analysis
   - [06_Lists_Applies.R](06_Lists_Applies.R)
